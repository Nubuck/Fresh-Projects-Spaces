This is the first time I'm using Firbase studio and I already feeling like this is the place for me.
Thank you, your assessment is excellent and has given me the perspective I needed.
Now please guide me on the best way for us to communicate about assets and files in the project, so for now I will reference project assets and files by relative paths.

I am going to answer your clarifying questions, followed by a directive on my updated design decisions from the perspective of your assesment:

- Q: What is the format of the floorplan asset provided in the Google Drive link (SVG, raster image, etc.)? This will significantly impact the floorplan implementation strategy.
    - A: I have added a few of the provided assets in the work space folder /context/assets (this was the mention of the shared Google drive - no integration needed I just downloaded the assets) - the floor plans and the property space images are all jpg format - they are quite large and I feel should be optimized before being served to a public consumer web site that should load as quickly as possible - so perhaps we can look at Analogs API route to compress and optimize an initial image asset and lazy load the high quality images after initial load - or if there is some fetching assistance Analog can offer
- Q: Are there any specific performance metrics or targets you should aim for (e.g., a certain Lighthouse score)? Knowing this can help prioritize optimization efforts.
    - A: since we are here in firebase studio and I am most familiar with Google products and conventions, lets go with the Google page speed metrics
- Q: Are there any constraints on the use of external libraries beyond the ones you've already chosen (Analog, Tailwind, spartan/ui)?
    - A: not specifically, I am open to using the best tool for the job - my choice to use Analog is because Fresh Projects uses Angular and I chose spartan/ui because it is inspired by Shadcn/ui the copy paste components I have come to rely on - it also is less friction than a UI library because the component code lives in the code base and can easily be edited to our needs. I realised from your assessment I wrote the solution design before I received the assets - there are no SVG floor plan assets and thus we must assume svg floor plans are not in scope and to be disregarded.

Now I will explain the changes to the solution design after your assessment:
- Hard Coded data only - Simon the CEO did mention that backend services are not a requirement and static data is expected - I still want to use either Analog API routes or just the Analog data fetching as a simulated back end demonstration of my 25 years of full stack development - so lets disregard the SQLite and dynamic data features - I've been so busy this week I don't even have time for this feature anyway - no separate services - use what Analog provides as much as possible
- I was exploring the firebase studio and I see I can host web app with Firebase - would Firebase be able to host this Analog app as a more convenient alternative to the planned Fly.io?
- My plan for optimization demonstration can be simply stated: leveraging Angalog server side rendering to speed up initial page load and serving optimized image assets with a lazy loaded image after initial page load for high quality images.

Now in terms of UI design I do not have any mock up designs, so I am hoping you can assist creating the UI to maximize clean, user friendliness, Tailwind CSS and spartan/ui provide good design system patterns to achieve this. I have also included the Fresh Projects SVG logo at /context/fp_logo_horizontal.svg and the Fresh Project brand colors from their website at https://www.gofreshprojects.com/ in the file /context/freshprojects.css to use as the brand them from the project - naturally to not use the /context/freshprojects.css file directly but use the css color and font variables as the Tailwind theme settings.

With all that said, please let me know if there is any further clarifying questions you have before you start generating the project to the requirements we have covered.
