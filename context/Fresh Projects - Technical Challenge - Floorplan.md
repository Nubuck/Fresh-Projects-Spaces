# Challenge

Using the technology of your choice, create a simple web app that allows a seller to
showcase their home to potential buyers.

You do not need to do any account logins, management, etc.

The app will be just a single page (for 1 house) that includes:
● General title/short description/price/address/thumbnail of the house
● Has a floorplan of the house as the navigation element
● When you click on a room in the floorplan, the following details are loaded below the
plan:
○ Room name
○ Room description
○ Photos of the room
● The page should be responsive for mobile devices
● You can use any assets you wish. We have provided some optional assets to use:
